## Hi there 👋
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- ✨  I’m currently working on security skills and discovering the security world. I try to unlock containers from TryHackMe and in the past I tried some excersises from HackThisSite.Beside that I try to do red team excersises from HTB<br>
- 🐶  I’m currently following the penetration tester career path from HTB<br>
- 🐣 Fun fact: Fire emblem is my favourite game , specific Birthright beside that I love critical thinking and Stoicism.

- 🌸 Working on:
     <br> - Improving old containers(adding more clearer description,pictures etc.) For example:
            - THM: Anthem 
            - THM: Ricky and Morty
            - HTS: B1 t/m B5
     <br> - I improved my workflow, so the containers which I am currently working on are available.
