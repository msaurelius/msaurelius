      <td>For my working experience company I built an CRAN beside testing for 6 months.
A CRAN is simplified a home made library which can be modified by the R developers of the company. The CRAN which I needed to built was
used for internal only. And I learned about package management.<br>
What did I learn?: <br>

- R<br>
- Package management<br>
- Writing manual<br>
- Dynamically(User can download from CRAN but only developers can adjust it. Dynamically approach, it needs to be accesible for the employees and not only for the people who develop R)</td></td>

      <td>I learned several things from this machine. For example I used FTP for the first time.Some elements were already known such as brute force and reading files. Although some elements were new such as the ZIP file password were I used binwalk. It was interesting to go in depth on getting information based on a picture. Transcibing a code into regular text(from BASE64) was familiar and I thought it was a fun concept. Afterwards I used Jack the ripper which was my first time.</td>
