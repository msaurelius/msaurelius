## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<b>I am a graduated application developer. For my graduation project I created a interactive WYSIWYG mobile application in React-Native and TypeScript(incl. architecture). In my spare time I was mainly focused on learning React and Python. After graduating I did an internship at a research company and I discoverd testing. In combination of my own interest and the chance to develop the skills for an tester , I started to go in depth. When my internship was over I started to do research on cyber security and discovered a lot of information. In combination with social media and learning platforms I discoverd that I have the ambition to become a pentester. In order to practice my practical skills I unlock containers from TryHackMe and small challenges (like Sherlock) from HackThisBox).
Beside the practical side , I am also interested in the theory so I recently starting to following the career path penetration testing from HackThisBox. </b>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently following the penetration tester from HTB
